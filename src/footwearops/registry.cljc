  "Pure-function domain logic for the footwear plant-operations
  coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification, shipment-volume
  recompute, quality-grade validation, defect-rate plausibility
  validation, and draft maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination
  record construction.

  This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/footwear`-style
  capability library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists in this
  workspace). The domain logic therefore lives here as pure functions,
  re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by `footwearops.governor` -- the same
  'ground truth, not self-report' discipline every sibling actor's own
  registry establishes (most directly `sawmilling.registry`'s
  `shipment-volume-exceeded?`, this build's own closest domain
  analog): never trust a proposal's own self-reported volume/status
  when the inputs needed to recompute it independently are already on
  record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real factory-management system. It builds the DRAFT
  record a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled maintenance
  window, a coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating cutting/
  lasting/assembly-line equipment or dispatching a real freight
  carrier (this actor NEVER does either -- see README `What this
  actor does NOT do`).")
